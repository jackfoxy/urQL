# DELETE
(currently supported in urQL parser, not yet supported in Obelisk)

Deletes rows from a `<table-set>`.

```
<delete> ::=
  DELETE [ FROM ] <table-set>
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]
  [ <as-of-time> ]
```
## API
```
+$  delete
  $:
    %delete
    table=qualified-object
    predicate=(unit predicate)
  ==
```

## Arguments

**`<table-set>`**
The target of the `DELETE` operation.

**`<predicate>`**
Any valid `<predicate>`, including predicates on CTEs.

## Remarks

When `<table-set>` is a `<table>`, the command potentially mutates `<table>` resulting in a state change of the Obelisk agent.

A stand-alone `DELETE` statement can only operate on a `<table>` and produces a `<transform>` of one command step.

Data in the *sys* namespace cannot be deleted.

When `<table-set>` is a virtual table, the command produces an output `<table-set>` which may be consumed as a pass-thru by a subsequent `<transform>` step.

## Produced Metadata

@@ROWCOUNT returns the total number of rows deleted

## Exceptions
`<table>` does not exist
`GRANT` permission on `<table>` violated
