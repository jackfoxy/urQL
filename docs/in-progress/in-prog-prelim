<table-set> ::=

  | ( column-1 [,...column-n] )

```

...

`( column-1 [,...column-n] )` assigns column names to the widest row type of an incoming pass-thru table.

`*` accepts an incoming pass-thru virtual-table assuming column names established by the previous set-command (`DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, `QUERY`, or `UPDATE`) that created the pass-thru.

Similarly `*` as the output of `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `MERGE` creates a pass-thru virtual-table for consumption by the next step or ultimate product of a `<selection>`.
